👋 Hi, I’m @BoostersEngaged
👀 I’m deeply passionate about statistics, computer science, AI & Computer Graphics (CG), and cross-dimensional (X-D) rebuilding. I thrive on exploring the intersection of these fields to create innovative solutions and push the boundaries of technology.
🌱 I’m currently honing my skills in programming with Python and C++, focusing on writing efficient, scalable, and maintainable code. I’m also diving into advanced topics like machine learning systems (MLsys) and real-time rendering techniques in Computer Graphics.
💞️ I’m eager to collaborate on projects related to MLsys and Computer Graphics, particularly those involving distributed machine learning, neural rendering, 3D reconstruction, or physics-based simulations. If you’re working on something exciting in these areas, let’s connect!
📫 You can reach me at boyuanzhu03@outlook.com. I’m always open to discussing new ideas, sharing knowledge, or exploring potential collaborations. Let’s build something amazing together!
